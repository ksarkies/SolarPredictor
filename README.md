Solar Power System Simulator
----------------------------

This project aims to provide a tool for modelling a grid connected solar power
system with fixed or following modules and with or without maximum power point
tracker. It accounts for solar declination and atmospheric absorption and
provides for a primitive model of cloud cover.

The result is the savings resulting from power usage offset and feed in of
excess power to the grid.

TODO
* add file saving and loading of parameters.
* incorporate battery storage for non-grid connected systems to aid in
  deciding the size and number of modules and batteries.
* add in average solar irradiance measurements rather than chunky cloud cover.
